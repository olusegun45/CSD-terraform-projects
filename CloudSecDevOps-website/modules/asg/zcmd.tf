/* Here is an example Terraform script that creates an AWS Auto Scaling Group module with an 
Auto Scaling policy and CloudWatch trigger, and launches instances in it:

module "autoscaling_group" {
  source = "./modules/autoscaling_group"
  
  vpc_id = var.vpc_id
  subnet_ids = var.subnet_ids
  launch_configuration_name = aws_launch_configuration.example.name
  min_size = var.min_size
  max_size = var.max_size
  desired_capacity = var.desired_capacity
  
  scaling_policy_name = "example-scaling-policy"
  scaling_policy_adjustment_type = "ChangeInCapacity"
  scaling_policy_adjustment = 1
  scaling_policy_cooldown = 300
  
  cloudwatch_metric_name = "CPUUtilization"
  cloudwatch_metric_namespace = "AWS/EC2"
  cloudwatch_metric_statistic = "Average"
  cloudwatch_metric_unit = "Percent"
  cloudwatch_metric_threshold = 70
  cloudwatch_metric_comparison_operator = "GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold"
  cloudwatch_metric_period = 300
  cloudwatch_metric_evaluation_periods = 2
  cloudwatch_metric_alarm_name = "example-cpu-alarm"
}

resource "aws_launch_configuration" "example" {
  image_id = var.image_id
  instance_type = var.instance_type
}

In this example, the Auto Scaling Group module is defined in a subdirectory named "modules", 
and it expects variables for VPC ID, subnet IDs, launch configuration name, min size, max size, 
and desired capacity to be passed in.

The module also creates an Auto Scaling policy that adjusts the number of instances based on a 
change in capacity and specifies a cooldown period.

Additionally, the script creates a CloudWatch alarm that triggers the scaling policy when the 
specified metric (CPU utilization) exceeds a specified threshold for a specified period.

It's important to note that this is just an example and the actual implementation may vary depending 
on the specific requirements of your application and the structure of your Terraform code. */
